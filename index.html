    <h1>The Life of Jeb</h1>

    <p>Jeb was a cool dude. He liked Dr Pepper. One day, he was walking along the street and saw something he would never have expected.</p>
    <p>It was a rabid dragon wearing a pair of pants. Jeb was scared.</p>
    <p>The scariest thing was the size of his uncomfortable pants. Because the dragon is so large, he can't wear standard Levi's. He's got to take it all the way back to 1995 and rock some Jenco's.</p>
    <p>After regaining his wits, Jeb noticed that the fire-breathing-pants-wearing dragon was actually warming up a grill.</p>
